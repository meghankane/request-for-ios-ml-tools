# request-for-ios-ml-tools
Ideas for tools that would help the end-to-end process for integrating machine learning models into iOS apps

- [ ] Swift scripting for data augmentation techniques
- [ ] Converting tensor flow model to core ml, integrating all parts of process (inspecting network, etc)
- [ ] Setting up tensor flow environment (python virtual env, dependencies & dependency version control, better error output)
- [ ] Evaluation tool for if tensor flow layers used will be supported in coreml
- [ ] Checking data input/output and inferring conversion parameters (e.g. via code generation)
- [ ] Better debugging at earliest stage
- [ ] Sanity checking metadata for conversion (e.g. with typing)
- [ ] Preparing datasets for use with tensorflow
- [ ] Hosting core ml models
- [ ] Evaluating performance metrics for core ml models on device
- [ ] Resources for iOS for machine learning (Meghan should aggregate the ones she has to start)
